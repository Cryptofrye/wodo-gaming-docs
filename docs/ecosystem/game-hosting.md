# Game Hosting

The gaming industry will be decentralized and democratized more and more with the influence of blockchains. This change will lead to more independent game developers and gaming startups building games in the gaming ecosystem. Thus it is a fundamental pillar for game developers to have a smooth game deployment flow and hosting environment that provides global availability, low latency, easy management, elasticity, scalability, and insights with data. To fulfill this gap, we designed the game server fleet. It is a framework for hosting, running, monitoring, and scaling dedicated game servers. All crypto-enabled games, that are available to the wodo community members through the wodo gaming hub, are deployed, hosted, and managed by the game server fleet.&#x20;

The game server fleet offers dedicated game server capability that enables a reliable, stable, and low latency deployment environment for a smooth gaming experience. Game developers avoid the heavy-lifting of game deployment and management process and focus on game development  Ultimately the game server fleet delivers responsive multiplayer gaming anywhere in the world.
