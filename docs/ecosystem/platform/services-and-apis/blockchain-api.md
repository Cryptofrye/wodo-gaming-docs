# Blockchain API

Blockchain APIs define a standard way of any blockchain integration into the wodo platform. Developers can implement and plug any blockchain integration into the platform as _blockchain engine implementations_. A blockchain engine consists of concantrate blockchain intergarion impmementaion conforming the platform's API standarts and other addinitional functionalties that are needed to make end-to-end integartion work. Out of the box, the wodo platform has a variety of blockchain integration implementations such as nano, banano, avalanche. Once blockchain engines are integrated into the wodo platform, all functionality and capabilities are made available to the public world (developers, game developers, 3rd party companies) via public APIs of the wodo platform
