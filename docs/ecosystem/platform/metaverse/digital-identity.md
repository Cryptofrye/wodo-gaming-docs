# Digital Identity

Metaverses need standard identity management similar to passports, to grant access to different services and metaverse platforms. Digital identities seem like customized avatars in the metaverses. But they are more than fancy avatars. A digital identity is a persistent interoperable, and decentralized digital entity often referred to as Self Sovereign Identity (SSI). The movement aims to protect user privacy through decentralized identifiers (DIDs), which digital passports can be thought of as.

Through digital identity standards and tools, people will re-create themself in metaverses. They will keep control of their identity management. The digital identity implementations will rely on blockchain technologies. The digital identity solution of the wodo gaming will adhere to the standards and evolve over the course of time.
